There’s a day when our hearts will be broken
When a shadow will cast out the light
And our eyes cry a million tears
Help won’t arrive
There’s a day when our courage collapses
And our friends turn and leave us behind
Creatures of darkness will triumph
The sun won’t rise

When we've lost all hope
And succumb to fear
And the skies rain blood
And the end draws near

I may fall
But not like this, it won’t be by your hand
I may fall
Not this place, not today
I may fall
Bring it all, it's not enough to take me down
I may fall

There’s a place where we’ll stand outnumbered
Where the wolves and the soul-less will rise
In the time of our final moments
Every dream dies
There’s a place where our shields will lay shattered
And the fear's all that's left in our hearts
Our strength and our courage have run out
We fall apart

When we lose our faith
And forsake our friends
When the moon is gone
And we've reached our end

I may fall

There’s a moment that changes a life when
We do something that no one else can
And the path that we’ve taken will lead us
One final stand
There’s a moment we make a decision
Not to cower and crash on the ground
The moment we face those demons
Our courage found

When we stand with friends
And we won’t retreat
As we stare down death
Then the taste is sweet

I may fall
But not like this, it won’t be by your hand
I may fall
Not this place, not today
I may fall
Bring it all, it's not enough to take me down
I may fall
I may fall
I may fall
I may, I may fall
